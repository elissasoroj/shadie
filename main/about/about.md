# Welcome to the `shadie` docs

## What is it?

`shadie` is a wrapper around SLiM that provides a user-friendly python API interface for generating models that incorporate alternation-of-generations. 

Coming Soon: we are currently working on functionality that would allow `shadie` to convert user-provided phylogeny into SLiM-compatible subpopulation demography.
