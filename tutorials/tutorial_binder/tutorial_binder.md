## Notebook Tutorials
Jupyter Notebook versions of all the tutorials are available [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/elissasoroj/shadie/HEAD?filepath=shadie%2Fnotebooks). There is a detailed notebook for each 'step' of using `shadie` and an example full workflow. 
*Note:* the notebooks hosted by binder will be able to perform most of the functionality of `shadie`, however it will *not* be able to run SLiM unless you have installed SLiM separately on your machine. `.trees` files are provided in the `trees files` folder to allow you to use the post-sim module of `shadie` without having to run simulations in SLiM.  


## Full Workflow

```python
