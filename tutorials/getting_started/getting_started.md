<h1>Getting Started</h1>

The tutorials on this site provide all the source code necessary to follow along in your own Jupyter Notebook. 

## Notebook Tutorials
If you prefer to download the full tutorials as Jupyter Notebooks, they are available [here](https://github.com/elissasoroj/shadie/tree/main/shadie/notebooks). There is a detailed notebook for each 'step' of using `shadie` and an example full workflow. 

You must have Jupyter Notebooks and `shadie` installed locally to use these notebooks. You must also install SLiM 4 to access all the functionality in the notebooks.

## binder Tutorials
Finally, if you do not have Jupyter on your machine, you are able to run the notebooks in your web broswer using binder. This is a great way to use `shadie` for teaching applications, with students that do not need to learn how to Jupyter or run SLiM themselves. However, keep in mind that any changes made in binder cannot be saved for later use. 

*Note:* the notebooks hosted by binder will be able to perform most of the functionality of `shadie`, but memory limitations make it difficult to run anything but the simplest SLiM simulations.
`.trees` files are provided in the `trees files` folder on GitHub to allow you to use the post-sim module of `shadie` without having to run simulations in SLiM.
